title: Austin, TX - Mobility Talks Meetings
organization: City of Austin, TX
notes: As great as Austin is, we struggle with transportation and mobility. Whether you drive, walk, bike, or take transit, your City Council wants to know your priorities for improving Austinâ€™s transportation network. Between March 21 and May 8, the City is asking for your feedback. Find us at any of the locations listed to be heard. The information you provide during Mobility Talks will be presented to the Mobility Committee of the City Council on June 8, 2016. The meeting will be at 3 p.m. in Council Chambers at City Hall, 301 W. 2nd Street. Learn more about Mobility Talks here www.mobilitytalks.org.
