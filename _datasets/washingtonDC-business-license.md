title: Washington, DC Basic Business Licenses
organization: District of Columbia
notes: In order to operate legally in District of Columbia, most businesses must obtain a Basic Business License (BBL) from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA). The Basic Business License program streamlines District of Columbia business licensing procedures. The BBL groups licenses by the type of business activity and regulatory approvals required. The dataset shows issued business licenses in all housing licenses, motor vehicle sales, service and repair, and home improvement contractors.  These data are shared via an automated process where addresses are batch matched (geocoded) to the District's Master Address Repository. Users may find that some data points will contain 0,0 for X,Y coordinates resulting in inconsistent spatial locations. Addresses for these data points could not be automatically geocoded and will need to be manually geocoded to 'best fit' locations in DC. Use the MAR Geocoder to help complete this. International address may not follow conventional US address format.
